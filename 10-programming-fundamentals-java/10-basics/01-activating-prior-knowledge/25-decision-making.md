# What will the value of string1 be
```java
    if ( (5>3) || ((3*67)<(70/12)) ) {
        string1 = “True”;
    } else {
        string1 = “False”;
    }
```

# Write a switch case that will print out the “sound” of an animal (Cat or Dog).No other animals exist so no need to provide other logic for our program.
