# Composition over Inheritance

Composition over inheritance, is an important rule to follow.
Inheritance usually leads to complex, difficult to maintain code.
Luckily you can replace most inheritance structures with a combination of composition and interfaces.
Let's put that into practice!

Change the following implementation (that you might remember from Abstract Classes), 
so that it no longer uses inheritance but interfaces instead.
Ofcourse keep the original functionality.
This means **no Abstract Classes** and **no extends** keyword!

### Hint
If you're stuck try creating an interface called EmployeeType. An Employee will use this type to
calculate its monthly salary.
